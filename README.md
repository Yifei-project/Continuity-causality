# Continuity-causality
This is an implemenation of causality framework named continuity causality, associated with time series analysis.
The concept of continuity causality can help identify some cases where other statistical causal methods like Granger causality [1] fail to detect causality.
The accepted interpretation is non-seperability of subsystem [2,3], while it is also expressed with causal faithfulness in other fields [4,5].

The parctical approach to detect causality based on this concept is also presented.
